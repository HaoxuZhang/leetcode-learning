You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Example:

[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Answer: 16


c:
//遍历整个数组，遇到1则count+=4,如果其上下左右存在1说明有重复情况。最后用count减去重复情况即可。
int islandPerimeter(int** grid, int gridRowSize, int gridColSize) {
    int count=0;
    int duplicate=0;
    for(int i=0;i<gridRowSize;i++)
    {
        for(int j=0;j<gridColSize;j++)
        {
            if(grid[i][j]==1)
            {
                count+=4;
                if(i!=0&&grid[i-1][j]==1) duplicate++;
                if(i!=gridRowSize-1&&grid[i+1][j]==1) duplicate++;
                if(j!=0&&grid[i][j-1]==1) duplicate++;
                if(j!=gridColSize-1&&grid[i][j+1]==1) duplicate++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count-duplicate;
}
