Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.

So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.

Note:

    Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
    Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
    As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
    All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.

//先排序，然后依次判断houses中的元素与heaters的最近那个个元素的最近距离。最后求出这些距离的最大值即可
void swap(int* i,int* j){
    int tmp=*i;
    *i=*j;
    *j=tmp;
}
int max(int i,int j){
    if(i>j) return i;
    return j;
}
int findRadius(int* houses, int housesSize, int* heaters, int heatersSize) {
    for(int i=0;i<housesSize-1;i++)
        for(int j=i+1;j<housesSize;j++)
            if(houses[i]>houses[j])
                swap(&(houses[i]),&(houses[j]));
    for(int i=0;i<heatersSize-1;i++)
        for(int j=i+1;j<heatersSize;j++)
            if(heaters[i]>heaters[j])
                swap(&(heaters[i]),&(heaters[j]));

            j++;
        minimum=max(minimum,abs(heaters[j]-houses[i]));
    }
    return minimum;
