 Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number. 
//质数因子只有2,3,5的被称为丑陋数

c:
//让该数不停的除以2,3,5，那么最后是1的话就是丑陋数（1也是丑陋数）
bool isUgly(int num) {
    while(num>=2)
    {
        if(num%2==0) num/=2;
        else if(num%3==0) num/=3;
        else if(num%5==0) num/=5;
        else return false;
    }
    return num==1;
}
